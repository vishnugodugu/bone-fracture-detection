### Hierarchical Deep Learning Framework for Bone Fracture Detection from X-ray Images

---

## 📌 Overview

**FractureAI** is a deployment-ready, hierarchical deep learning system designed to automatically detect bone fractures from musculoskeletal X-ray images.

Built using the **MURA (Musculoskeletal Radiographs) dataset**, the system leverages **EfficientNetB1-based transfer learning**, incorporates **Explainable AI (Grad-CAM + ROI)** for interpretability, and is deployed through a **Flask web application** capable of generating AI-assisted radiology reports in PDF format.

This project combines research-grade modeling with real-world deployment architecture.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 🔹 Training / System Architecture

1. Dataset collection (MURA)
2. Image preprocessing (224×224 resizing, normalization)
3. Train–validation–test split
4. Multi-class anatomical classification
5. Conditional routing
6. Bone-specific fracture detection models
7. Model evaluation

### 🔹 Deployment Architecture

1. Web-based X-ray upload
2. Flask backend processing
3. Pre-trained model inference
4. Explainable AI visualization
5. PDF report generation

Training is performed offline. Deployment uses pre-trained models for inference only.

## 🧠 Model Design

| Component  | Description                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Backbone   | EfficientNetB1                      |
| Input Size | 224 × 224 RGB                       |
| Strategy   | Transfer Learning                   |
| Tasks      | Multi-class + Binary classification |
| Output     | Fractured / Normal                  |

### Hierarchical Classification Strategy

1️⃣ **Stage 1:** Identify anatomical region
2️⃣ **Stage 2:** Route image to bone-specific fracture model

This improves generalization and reduces inter-anatomy feature confusion.

## 🔎 Explainable AI (XAI)

To ensure clinical interpretability:

* **Grad-CAM** highlights influential image regions
* **ROI extraction** localizes relevant structural areas

Visual explanations are displayed alongside predictions and embedded in generated reports.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-score
* Loss

Metrics are computed separately for each anatomical region.
